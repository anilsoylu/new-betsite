# Rounds

Most leagues have rounds related to the season. A round represents a week in which a fixture is played. With the rounds endpoint, we give you the ability to request data for a single round or for a whole season.

Use one of our 4 rounds endpoints. Per endpoint, you can find the details, including base URL, parameters, includes and more.&#x20;

- **GET All Rounds:** returns all the rounds available within your subscription.
- **GET Round by ID:** returns round information from your requested round ID.
- **GET Rounds by Season ID:** returns round information from your requested season ID.
