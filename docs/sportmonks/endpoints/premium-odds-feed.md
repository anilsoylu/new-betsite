{% hint style="info" %}
Our **Premium Odds Feed** provides a **history** of pre-match odds for fixtures for up to **7 days** after the match has started. Additionally, we offer the history of the odd. We document the opening odds for each fixture, and subsequently, all changes and updates are stored and accessible for your use. So, every (historical) odd value is available for a fixture until 7 days after the match has started (the 'starting_at' timestamp of the fixture).
