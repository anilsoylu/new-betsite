### 🧠 Team Rankings (Beta)

**Team Rankings** is a premium data feature that delivers historical and daily-updated **club rankings**, using an Elo-based model. It helps you evaluate club strength over time, whether for pre-match previews, performance modelling, or form-based content.

Unlike static league tables, Team Rankings offer a dynamic strength score that evolves daily, based on match results and opponent strength.

It’s ideal for betting platforms, match preview tools, and advanced stat-driven applications.

#### 📊 What’s Included?

Sportmonks’ team ranking model uses **Elo ratings** and data going back to **2005**. Rankings are updated daily at **00:00:00 UTC** and include:

- 🔢 **Current rank** – Daily team placement based on Elo
- 📆 **Date** – Rankings are available per day, from 2005 to today
- 📈 **Scaled score** – A normalized score between 0–100
- 🏷️ **Team ID** – Linked to the team object
- 🪪 **Ranking ID** – Unique identifier for the entry
